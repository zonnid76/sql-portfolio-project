# 1. UMG Data Analyst SQL Project
# 2. Project Objective
## a. The Problem
How can the potential for a song to become a top hit be estimated?
## b. Approach to Solving the Problem
To solve the problem, I am using data about song characteristics to find the average characteristics of hit songs.
Knowing this, the average characteristics of hit songs can then theoretically be used to predict the hit-making potential of songs, as a song should be more likely to become a hit if its characteristics are similar to those of existing top hits.
# 3. Job Description
## a. UMG Data Analyst Details
Universal Music Group (UMG) is the world's leading music company, owning and operating a broad array of businesses in more than 60 countries, including many record labels, such as Capitol Records, Def Jam Records, Island Records, and Republic Records.
My project is particularly based on the data analyst role at UMG.
Main points in the description for job postings of this role include using data-driven methods to discover, track, and analyze developing songs and artsts, as well as using intern and external data sources to perform detailed analysis that can leverage data for decision-making.
They are looking for somebody who is proficient on both Python and SQL, has experience working with music data, and has the ability to provide answers to loosely defined questions and provide actionable insights.
## b. Project Relationship to Job Posting
Given the job description, this project would help qualify me for the role.
If I can successfully leverage data of song characteristics to provide actionable insights on how to approach investing in artists, using SQL and Python, I would then meet the exact description/qualifications that UMG is looking for.
